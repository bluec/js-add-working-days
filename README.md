A JavaScript function to add a number of working days to a date object taking account of holidays and weekends
Checks each day added for being a holiday or weekend, so potentially unsuitable for adding large number of days

Holiday functionality from https://github.com/lsmith/addBusinessDays/blob/master/addBusinessDays.js
UK holiday dates from http://www.bluesock.com/bank_holidays_csv.php
